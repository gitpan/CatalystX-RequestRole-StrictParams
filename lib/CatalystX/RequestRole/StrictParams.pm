=head1 NAME

CatalystX::RequestRole::StrictParams - Insist users specify HTTP method for form parameters

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Insist users specify HTTP method for form parameters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyApp;

    use base 'Catalyst';
    use Catalyst;
    use CatalystX::RoleApplicator;

    __PACKAGE__->apply_request_class_roles('CatalystX::RequestRole::StrictParams');

=head1 EXPLANATION

Perl wrappers around the CGI protocol frequently make it too easy to write
exploitable code by conflating C<GET> and C<POST> parameters. Implementers
instead should be considering whether a given request is retrieving (I<GET>)
or modifying (I<POST>) data.

This role removes access to C<params>, C<parameters> and C<param> from
Catalyst request objects, forcing users to use C<body_parameters> and
C<query_parameters> instead.

=head1 WARNING

L<Cross-site Scripting|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting>
vulnerabilities are easy to introduce, and often subtle. While using this
module reduces the threat surface a little, it in no way provides general
protection from all (or maybe even most) attacks.
